# PHP1560-Final-Project

<p> Our research project poses the question: What is the relationship between the skin tone of a team player and the number of total cards given by a referee in a soccer game? To answer this question, we estimated the number of cards given to players and the probability that the referee gives a card, all alongside player skin colors, in order to run a simulation that simulates games with different referees given a subset of players (randomizes player subsets given their position utilizing the 4-2-3-1 soccer formation). From the simulation data frame, we then showcase our results through tables and graphs to analyze our research question and pose deeper ones. This project will hopefully illuminate any potential bias that may be faced by soccer players of different skin tones from referees that can affect gameplay. </p>

<p> This project utilizes the data found in the research paper <a href = "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245917747646">"Many Analysts, One Data Set: Making Transparent How Variations in Analytic Choices Affect Results"</a> by R. Silberzahn et al. </p>

<p>This data set is collected as part of the research that is looking to examine whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark skin toned players than light-skinned players. The link to the data set can be found <a href = "https://osf.io/47tnc/files/fv8c3">here </a>.</p>

<p> The files are structured numerically, with each large folder labeled 0 to 3, where users should start reading and replicating the code from 0 onward. Within each folder, a similar setup is used, where users should implement code sequentially within those folders. For example, to begin, start with folder 0. Data. From there, go first to 0.1. Cleaned Data. Afterwards, proceed to folder 1 and go down the scripts sequentially, and so forth.</p>

<p> All code is in R. To utilize the code, be sure to download the linked data set above and fix path names as needed. Be sure to download all packages given and run each code script given in the sequential order above, following documentation within the scripts as needed. </p>
