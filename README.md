# PHP1560-Final-Project

<p> Our research project poses the question: What is the relationship between the skin tone of a team player and the number of total cards given by a referee in a soccer game? To answer this question, we estimated the number of cards given to players and the probability that the referee gives a card, all alongside player skin colors, in order to run a simulation that simulates games with different referees given a subset of players (randomizes player subsets given their position utilizing the 4-2-3-1 soccer formation). From the simulation data frame, we then showcase our results through tables and graphs to analyze our research question and pose deeper ones. </p>

<p> This project utilizes the data found in the research paper <a href = "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245917747646">"Many Analysts, One Data Set: Making Transparent How Variations in Analytic Choices Affect Results"</a> by R. Silberzahn et al. </p>

<p>This data set is collected as part of the research that is looking to examine whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark skin toned players than light-skinned players. The link to the data set can be found <a href = "https://osf.io/47tnc/files/fv8c3">here </a>.</p>
